# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Information-Theory
This project presents a comprehensive approach to stock market prediction by combining machine learning with information-theoretic techniques. The focus is on forecasting the stock prices of Indian companies, with a detailed case study on Reliance Industries Ltd. The core of the project is a Linear Regression model trained on historical price data obtained from the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance). What sets this project apart is the integration of entropy-based features, such as Shannon Entropy and Sample Entropy, which quantify the uncertainty and randomness in stock price movements.

The system supports input through both CSV uploads and live ticker symbols, allowing for flexibility in data analysis. It calculates key technical indicators, performs entropy-based feature engineering, and generates visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted prices using interactive Plotly charts. The backend is built with Flask, while the frontend offers a clean and intuitive UI for uploading data and viewing results.

In addition to the implementation, a detailed research paper has been developed to explain the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, the mathematical formulations of entropy, and their impact on model performance. This project is ideal for anyone interested in quantitative finance, time series forecasting, or applying information theory to real-world datasets.
